 <h3>Whisper of the Heart</h3>
 <p>It's a cute and simple story, yet it's very inspiring and I love the theme song</p>
 
 <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
 <p>One of my first Ghibli movies, I watched it a few times but I never get tired of it.</p>
 
 <h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
 <p>It's childish but really cute</p>
